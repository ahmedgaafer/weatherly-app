## CI/ CD:

I wrote my own CI/CD [HERE](.github/workflows/main.yml) using github actions that builds, tests and deploys the app to github pages

## how to run the project:

1 - You can run the project by using the command

```
git clone https://github.com/ahmedgaafer/weatherly-app.git
```

2 - run this command to install all project dependencies:

```
npm install
```

3 - run this command to start the project locally

```
npm start
```

4 - A webpage will open that contains the project

---

## how to run the tests:

1 - after doing step 1 & 2 from [how to run the project:](#how-to-run-the-project)

2 - run this command in the terminal

```
npm test
```

3 - wait for all the tests to run and view the result
